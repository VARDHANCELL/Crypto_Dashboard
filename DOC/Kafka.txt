Kafka

Architecture -> 
                     Zookeeper --> used to monitor kafka cluster 
                         ^         stores kafka config in key value pairs
                         |         stores broker alive/dead status of brokers
                         |
                         |
Producer -provide-> Kafka Cluster -consume-> Consumer

Producer
Produce msg to topics
Can provide directly to topic(to each partition) or to a particular partition itself

Consumer
Consume the data
Directly from the topic or from a particular partition
Associated with a consumer group also only 1
Consumer groups consists of consumers consuming same type of data performing type of execution                     

Kafka cluster

consists of multiple brokers present parallel to each other
each broker consists of multiple topics parallel to each other
each topic has multiple partitions parallel to each other

Brokers/Kafka_servers

Maintain and manage the cluster
Manages the consumer offset which helps in delivering he right msg to right consumer


Topics 

Stream of data of a particular type
Name being only unique identifier
consists 2 properties:

Partitions -> split the data | records here are ordered and immutable | each record has it's unique offset |
Replication -> copy the data | only used when the partition is down | stored in diff broker as of the partition|


Features of kafka:

Provides horizontal scaling due to addition of new brokers within cluster
Provides fault tolerance due to the feature of replication
Provides high throughput -> no of msgs accepting/relieving per sec provides for both producer and consumer
