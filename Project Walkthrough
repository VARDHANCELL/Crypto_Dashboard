Project Architecture
Data Ingestion via REST API:

REST API Endpoints: Create or use existing REST API endpoints to collect data from various sources. These APIs will provide data that needs to be ingested into Kafka.
Kafka Producer: Develop a Kafka producer that consumes data from these REST APIs and publishes it to Kafka topics. This producer can be a standalone service or part of a broader data ingestion service.
Kafka Integration:

Kafka Topics: Data from REST APIs is streamed into Kafka topics. Kafka acts as the message broker, handling real-time data streams.
ETL Tool Integration:

ETL Orchestration: Use an ETL tool (e.g., Apache Airflow) to manage and automate the ETL pipeline. The ETL tool will schedule and orchestrate tasks related to data ingestion, processing, and analysis.
DAGs/Workflows: Define workflows to include Kafka data ingestion, PySpark processing, data loading, and reporting.
Data Processing with PySpark:

Kafka Consumer: PySpark jobs consume data from Kafka topics.
Transformation: Perform data transformations, aggregations, and other processing tasks in PySpark.
Storage: Load the processed data into a relational or NoSQL database.
Detailed Analysis with Pandas:

Data Extraction: Extract subsets of data from the database for in-depth analysis using Pandas.
Analysis and Reporting: Use Pandas for statistical analysis, generating reports, and preparing data for visualization.
Data Visualization:

Grafana: Connect Grafana to the database for real-time dashboards and visualizations of key metrics and trends.
Management Interface with Django:

Django Application: Develop a Django web application to:
Manage and monitor the ETL pipeline.
Start/stop ETL jobs.
View logs and pipeline status.
Run and display Pandas-based reports.
REST API Integration: If needed, expose additional REST API endpoints from Django for external applications to interact with the data or control the ETL pipeline.
